Our group did a investigated adolescents' progression throughout a videogame using:
1. __demographic data, 
2. __happiness ratings, 
3. __final skill levels, 
4. __risk metrics__ and 
5. __percentage complete game progression

by classifying their categories into 3:

### Prioritisation

- The team checked their overall final skills and skill progression by gender, ethnicity, risk metric and found subtle differences in their final skill levels.
- We also attempted to see if there was any difference on the skill progression by checking different schools.

### Perseverance

- Our group compared the maximum attempts made by teenagers - examined by gender, ethnicity, and school.

### Perception

- We explored their satisfaction when they have completed the game.

## Programs used
 For analysis and presentation, R was used.

## Conclusion
 
 1. The effect of demographics was consistent across prioritisation and perseverance.
 2. There is a strong potential for using the characteristics of perception as significant predictor of identifying individuals who are more inclined towards risk taking behaviours.
